We are announcing the start of the libre2d project!

After being inspired by popular vtubers, I wanted to get into vtubing too, but
with completely open source software. Currently the only way (that I know of)
to do that is with 3D models, via blender, and then maybe the Xbox Kinect? But
I wanted to do something more on the lines of Live2D, which is a technique to
generate anime-style 2D graphics. The only software out there that does this so
far is proprietary, so I've started this project to make an open source
implementation. It's be a long journey.

So far it's only me working on this project, but I'm hoping that I can get some
more people to contribute, especially with Qt and OpenGL, as I'm not very
familiar with them so I'm having to learn them as I go. Which is fine, but it's
costing a lot of time while I don't make any code progress :/

I managed to register a [Github organization][github-org], and so I
pushed my [preliminary code][paul-dev] there too. It's not very pretty,
as I'm still drafting and exploring things, and there's no pretty output that I
can show off yet. But, putting it up there should help create some social
pressure to get me to keep moving and prevent me from getting lazy. There is a
[design document][github-readme] that outlines my plan.

As much as I would like to use IRC and mailing lists, I didn't want to deal
with managing a mailing list, and I was thinking that more modern (?) tools
could draw in younger (?) contributors, so I've set up a [discord server][discord]
(maybe later I could add a discord-IRC linking bot). Come join us!
