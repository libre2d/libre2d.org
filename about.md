Welcome to libre2d!

Our goal is to create an open source implementation of generating anime-style
2D graphics with layered drawings, mainly for the purpose of making open source
vtubing more accessible.

We have a [Github organization][org], a [Github repo][repo], and a [discord server][discord].
Come join us!
